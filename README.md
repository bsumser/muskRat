# muskRat
Elon Musk based twitter paper trading algorithm, using [twitterscraper](https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper) and pandas dataframes. Central idea behind this project is to scrape twitter for a user's posts, and overlay the tweets coombined with relevant stock information onto a candlestick chart. The python code is written inside of a jupyter notebook, and output of the candlestick chart is handled with plotly/matplotlib.
